# Exercise notebooks for PHY 221

The exercise notebooks are designed to be completed at the end
of each Activity notebooks.

The exercise notebooks are developed using
[nbgrader](http://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/). For most exercises there
are tests to guide the student as to whether or not their
implementation functions correctly.
